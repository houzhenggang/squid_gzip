This patch add the feature of http compression on the fly for squid-2.7

=INSTALLATION=

Get the source from http://github.com/yaoweibin/squid_gzip

cd squid-2.7
patch -p1 < /path/to/http_gzip.patch

compile squid with the following command:

./bootstrap.sh && ./configure --enable-http-gzip && make

=EXAMPLE=

<code>
http_gzip on
http_gzip_types text/html,text/plain
</code>

=DIRECTIVES=
    ==http_gzip==
    syntax: http_gzip on|off
    default: on
    context: main
    description: switch the http compression 

    ==http_gzip_types==
    syntax: http_gzip_types [mime types]
    default: text/html
    context: main
    description: This directive set the MIME types list which need to be 
    compressed. The types need be separated by ',' and there should not 
    be any space between types.

    ==http_gzip_hash==
    syntax: http_gzip_hash memLevel
    default: 8
    context: main
    description: The memlevel parameter specifies how much memory should be
    allocated for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory
    but is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory
    for optimal speed. 

    ==http_gzip_comp_level==
    syntax: http_gzip_comp_level level
    default: 9
    context: main
    description: The compression level, between 1 and 9, where 1 is the 
    least compression (fastest) and 9 is the most (slowest).

    ==http_gzip_min_length==
    syntax: http_gzip_min_length length
    default: 0
    context: main
    description: Sets the minimum length of of the response that will be
    compressed. Responses shorter than this will not be compressed. Length is
    determined from the "Content-Length" header.

    ==http_gzip_window==
    syntax: http_gzip_window windowBits
    default: 15
    context: main
    description: The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the
    window size (the size of the history buffer). It should be in the range
    8..15 for this version of the library. Larger values of this parameter
    result in better compression at the expense of memory usage. 

    ==http_gzip_prealloc==
    syntax: http_gzip_prealloc size
    default: 256 KB
    context: main
    description:  We preallocate a memory for zlib in one buffer (default:
    256K), this decreases a number of malloc() and free() calls and also
    probably decreases a number of syscalls (sbrk()/mmap() and so on).

=TODO=
* add deflate
